## Overview
This is a 2-player PvP board game. Each player will take turns to fire missiles into the opponent's territory until all ships from one player are completely destroyed. 

## Battleship Board 

* Size of board: 10 x 10

* Number of ship: 5

* Carrier (grey): 5x1 tile

* Battleship (blue): 4x1 tile

* Cruiser (purple): 3x1 tile  

* Submarine (green): 3x1 tile

* Destroyer (light blue): 2x1 tile

## Start of round: 
You can place and rotate your ships the way you like. You can also choose to randomise ship arrangement.

## Game round:
### Missile:
For each round, a player can fire N missiles according to N ships that are remaining (i.e 4 ships = 4 missiles), at the enemy territory on any selected block. A missile will destroy a 1x1 block of an opponent's territory, destroyed territory will be displayed on the map and can not be destroyed again. An explosion animation will be played after the missile is fired. If a missile hits an enemyâ€™s ship, fire animation will be played continuously on that block.

### Sonic detection:
If a player has a submarine, he can either choose to fire N missiles or use sonic detection for a round. Sonic detection will relieve enemy territory with 3 x 3 tiles. The player can choose the dedicated block as the center of sonic detection to scan the area. A concentric wave animation will be played.
